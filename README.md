## Mutation Prediction

### Data
preparetoClassify.csv file includes dataset with labels and used for training of model. Around 4500 data.
allResults.txt includes mutations with features from ELASPIC this dataset is for prediction.

### Dependencies
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
XGBoost
scikit-learn

### Objective
This project was done to implement a machine learning model to predict type of mutations.ELASPIC was used to extract features from INTACT mutation interaction dataset.
